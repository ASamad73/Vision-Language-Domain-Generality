  <i>Investigating Robustness under Distribution Shift: From Empirical Risk Minimization to CLIP Prompt Alignment</i>
</p>

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository explores the post-training challenges of making machine learning models robust to distribution shifts. Our research covers three primary pillars of modern robustness:

1.  **Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)**: Aligning feature distributions between labeled source domains and unlabeled target domains using DAN, DANN, and Entropy Minimization.
2.  **Domain Generalization (DG)**: Evaluating invariant learning techniques (IRM, Group-DRO) and geometric optimization (SAM) to find flat minima that generalize to unseen environments.
3.  **Vision-Language Stability (CLIP)**: Investigating if prompts act as a stable "control knob" for adaptation, using gradient-alignment techniques to mitigate interference.

## 🧑‍💻 My Contributions (Abdul Samad)
I led **Task 3: CLIP Prompt Learning & Stability**, where I focused on the integration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning with gradient-based consensus methods:

* **Prompt-Based DA Framework**: Formulated a DA framework using **CoOp-style learned context vectors** combined with an **unsupervised entropy minimization loss**. This achieved **22.17% accuracy** on stylized domains, significantly outperforming zero-shot (17.33%) and linear probing (20.23%).
* **Gradient Alignment (PCGrad)**: Orchestrated a multi-source gradient alignment strategy using **Projected Conflicting Gradients (PCGrad)**. By projecting conflicting domain gradients onto orthogonal planes, I **doubled the average cosine similarity** between gradient vectors (0.17 ➔ 0.33), effectively mitigating negative interference.
* **Robustness Quantification**: Analyzed the trade-off between adaptation and open-set robustness using **AUROC** and **Mean Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP)**. I identified "architectural brittleness," where prompt tuning improved domain-specific performance (AUROC to 0.56) but led to near-orthogonal embeddings (0.0132 similarity) and overconfidence on unseen classes.

## 🧠 Architecture & Methodology

### 🔹 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
* **Approach**: Evaluated models on the Digit-Bench (MNIST, SVHN, USPS). 
* **Key Finding**: Purely adversarial methods (DANN/CDAN) are enhanced significantly by **Entropy Minimization**, which forces the model to make confident predictions on the unlabeled target domain.

### 🔹 DG via Invariant & Robust Learning
* **Techniques**: Compared IRM, Group-DRO, and **Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)**.
* **Key Finding**: SAM consistently outperformed IRM and Group-DRO on the PACS dataset. By seeking **geometrically flat minima**, SAM avoids over-fitting to specific domain variances, preserving class discriminability.

### 🔹 CLIP Stability 
* **Problem**: Does prompt tuning on stylized data (e.g., Sketch) degrade CLIP's general knowledge?
* **Mechanism**: Implemented learnable prompts and **PCGrad** to ensure that updates from "Domain A" do not cancel out the performance on "Domain B."
